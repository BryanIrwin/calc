Simple Pay Calculator

I created this for a private customer, and they wanted a desktop only application (no web). 
It seems everyone is focused on the web, while ignoring that some customers don't want their applications exposed to the world. 

The first iteration which uses html, css and javascript do well, exccept don't offer direct access to the hard drive, so I went with JavaFX. 

The features they wanted are to calculate an entire week's pay, done by hourly rate. 
The ability to add workers, and pay rates. 
Being able to pick a set start and end time, while excluding certain days all together. 

This app does all of that with the addition of being able to save the results in a .txt file for printing.
